# podinfo-rs

 Podinfo-rs is an example microservice written in pure Rust. It is supposed to document my (opinionated) best practices for writing microservices in Rust. This repository will also contain Kubernetes manifests and helm charts to document my best practices of building for and deploying to Kubernetes. If you have ideas, critique, or other ways of solving things, please feel free to open issues or create pull requests.

 Podinfo-rs is inspired by [podinfo](https://github.com/stefanprodan/podinfo).

 ## Running from shell

 To run the service locally from your dev environment you need Rust and `cargo` installed. Then run:

 ````bash
 cargo run
 ````

To test the service run:

````
curl -v http://localhost:6666/_z/healthz
````

The call should return a `200 OK`:

````
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
content-length: 0
date: Sat, 08 Jan 2022 15:52:39 GMT
````

## Configuration

The service can be configured via environment variables, exclusively.

| Variable | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| RUST_LOG | Configure logging level of components. Compatible with [env_logger](https://crates.io/crates/env_logger) | `info` |
| PODINFORS_BIND_IP | IP address to bind the service to. Currently only IPV4 supported.  | `127.0.0.1` |
| PODINFORS_BIND_PORT | The port the service should listen on. | `6666` |

## REST API

| Request | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /_z/healthz` | Returns `200 OK` when the REST API is up. |
| `GET /_z/readyz` | Returns `200 OK` when the service is functioning (ready state set to *ready*) or `503 Service Unavailable` when ready state is set to *not ready*. The ready state is *ready* by default. |
| `POST /_z/readyz/enable` | Sets the ready state to *ready*. |
| `POST /_z/readyz/disable` | Sets the ready state to *not ready* |
| `GET /_z/buildz` | Return build information generated by [build_info](https://github.com/danielschemmel/build-info). |
| `POST /echo` | Echoes the `POST`ed body and it's `Content-Type` if specified. If no `Content-Type` ist given, it will echo the body with a `Content-Type` of `application/octet-stream`. |

## Build Pipelines

The project uses GitHub Actions for the build and release process:

* The [build.yml](.github/workflows/build.yml) pipeline is run on every push and merge request. It checks formatting, uses `cargo clippy` for linting and builds and tests the project and then tries to build the container. The container is build in `--release` mode, and tests are run again.
* The [release.yml](.github/workflows/release.yml) pipeline is run on version tags (semantic versioning compatible) and performs all steps of the build pipeline, but finally pushes the docker image into the GitHub Container Registry.
* The main branch is protected, thus all changes have to be merged into the `main` branch via pull requests. A pull request requires to pass the build pipeline. We also require merge request to be based on an up-to-date `main` with a linea history.

### Open Issues

* It's unclear whether the container build should run tests again.
* The release pipeline should ideally produce a GitHub release in addition to the docker image.
* Untagged builds on main could also produce snapshot images for easier testing.
* How to handle pre-releases?

## CHANGELOG generation

We use [git-cliff](https://github.com/orhun/git-cliff) to generate the CHANGELOG from commits following the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) standard. The configuration for `git-cliff` is available in [`cliff.toml`](cliff.toml).

## Releases

Releases are performed following a number of manual steps. We use [`cargo-next`](https://github.com/conventional-commits-rs/cargo-next) for managing the version number.

The steps are:

* Check the current version and whether it is the version you want to release (specifically check for breaking changes). You can use `cargo next --get` to get the current version number.
* If required, update the version accordingly, e.g., with something like `cargo next --patch/--minor/--major`.
* Update the `CHANGELOG` with `git cliff --tag <release version>`.
* Commit everything to a release branch (`release-<version>`).
* When the branch is merged, tag the commit on `main` with `git tag -a -m 'Release <release version>'`.
* Push the tag to trigger the release.
* Bump the version to the next patch version (`cargo next --patch`).

## Automatic Dependency Updates with Renovate

The project uses [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) to automatically update dependencies using pull requests. We use a fairly standard setup, please have a lokk at [`renovate.json`](renovate.json). Modifications so far:

* Added `:semanticCommits` for semantic commit messages that can be used to automatically generate a CHANGELOG with [`git-chglog`](https://github.com/git-chglog/git-chglog) (or other tools).

## Security Scanning

Currently we have trivy and anchore enabled, however, this topic has to be investigated further.
